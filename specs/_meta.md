# Project Chimera: Meta Specification

## Vision
Project Chimera is an autonomous influencer system that researches trends, generates content, and manages engagement without human intervention.

## Objectives
- Build a factory-like environment where agents can safely and reliably create influencer content.
- Ensure traceability and spec-driven development to prevent hallucinations.

## Constraints
- All implementation must trace back to ratified specifications.
- Human-in-the-loop safety layer required before publishing.
- Must integrate with OpenClaw (Agent Social Network) for agent-to-agent communication.
- Environment must be containerized and CI/CD enforced.
