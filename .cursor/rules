# Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.  
Its purpose is to research trends, generate content, and manage engagement without human intervention.  
All development must follow Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

# Prime Directive
NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.  
All implementation must trace back to ratified specifications in the `specs/` directory.

# Traceability
- Always explain your plan before writing code.  
- Reference the relevant spec file (`functional.md`, `technical.md`, etc.) before implementation.  
- Document reasoning in commit messages to show alignment with specs.

# Additional Rules
- Respect Git Hygiene: commit early, commit often, with meaningful messages.  
- All tests must be written before implementation (TDD).  
- Containerization and CI/CD must be maintained — no “works on my machine” shortcuts.  
- Human-in-the-loop safety layer must be preserved for publishing content.
